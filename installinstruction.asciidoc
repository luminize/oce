remarks for myself for not forgetting
this is how I ininitially built pythonocc

clone opencascade framework into your home folder
make sure the version match with your version of pythonocc-core
therefor I made the 16-1 branch.

after cloning into /home/you/oce

[source,shell]
---
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
flags="-DOCE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/oce -DOCE_DRAW:BOOL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIB:BOOL=OFF"
cmake flags ..
make
make test
make install
---

the files you need for pythonocc-core are now in /home/you/oce/include/oce and
/home/you/oce/lib

then cd to your clone of pythonocc-core in /home/you/python0cc-core

[source,shell]
---
cd ~/pythonocc-core
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake -DOCE_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/bas/oce/include/oce -DOCE_LIB_PATH=/home/bas/oce/lib ..
make
sudo make install
cd ../test
python run_tests.py
---

done
